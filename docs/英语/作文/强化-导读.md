Many of us, whatever our field of work, fear that showing uncertainty can damage our image—and we may compensate by expressing overconfidence in an attempt to win trust. But in many situations people are willing to trust those who can admit they don’t have a definitive answer. Recent studies found that communicating uncertainty and even admitting our mistakes is not harmful and can even be beneficial to trustworthiness. So, failure in “expertise” can be compensated by higher integrity and benevolence. When communicating uncertainty in a transparent way, we are perceived as less biased and willing to tell the truth.
