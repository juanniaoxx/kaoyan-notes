{++题干++}

- In the {++opening paragraph++}, the author introduces his topic by .... 重点看首段
- The statement "it is all too monkey" implies that ...  经典推断题,需要结合前后文
- {++Female capuchin monkeys++} were chosen for the research most probably because ...
- {++Dr.Brosnan and Dr.de Waal++} have {++eventually++} found in their study that the monkeys 
- What can we {++infer++} from the last {++paragraph++} 重点看尾段,是推测题

### Paragraph1 T21 T22
Everybody loves a fat pay rise. ^^Yet^^ pleasure at your own can {++vanish++}(消失) if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one.  

Indeed, if he has a {++reputation++}(n.名气,名声,名誉) for {++slacking++}(adj.松弛的->懒散的), you might even be {++outraged++}(n.愤怒;暴行).

Such behaviour is regarded as "all too human," ^^with^^ the underlying assumption that other animals would not be {++capable++}(adj.能干的,能胜任的;有能力的) of this {++finely++}(adv.细微地,精细地) developed sense of {++grievance++}(n.委屈,不满).

^^But^^ a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, {++suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.++}

回答T21

- posing a contrast. 举个反例
- justifying an assumption 证明了个猜想
- making a {++comparison++}(n.对比.类比) 做了个对比(类比)
- explaining a phenomenon 解释了一个现象

前两个选项很容易排除,问题在于3和4. 题目问的是用啥方法引出了本文的主题,文本主题是啥?是关于猴子也有类似于人类关于不公平的情感.那么作者前面巴拉巴拉那么一大堆关于"人"的就不可能是通过解释一个现象引出主题. 举个例子,高中物理讲电,通过摩擦生电这一个现象引出"电"这一概念.现象必须和文章内容有相一致.

当然这是一个关于{++comparison++}这个词意思的考察,这个词有比较的意思,但也有类比之意.

回答T22

- monkeys are also outraged by slack {++rival++}(n. pl 对手)s.
- {++resenting++}(vt.对....感到怨恨) unfairness is also monkeys' nature.
- monkeys, like humans, tend to be {++jealous++}(adj.嫉妒的) of each other.
- no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions.

这道题其实仅看第一段,并不能确定选B/C. 当然如果足够敏感可以选出B,关于为啥不是嫉妒而是不公可以看后文的试验内容.
### Paragraph2 T23
The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. {++Above all++}(首要,尤其是), like their female human {++counterparts++}(n. pl 同行), they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of "goods and services" than males.

T23

- more {++inclined++}(vt.倾向于) to weigh what they get.
- attentive to researcher's instructions.
- nice in both appearance and temperament.
- more generous than their male companions.

这道题比较显然,只能是A选项. 通过 ^^Above all^^ 后面的内容可以确认.

### Paragraph3 
^^Such^^(指代上文,同时提醒T23答案) characteristics make them perfect {++candidates++}(n.候选人) for Dr. Brosnan's and Dr. de Waal's study. 

The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of {++cucumber++}(黄瓜). 

^^However^^, when two monkeys were placed in separate but {++adjoining++}(adj.相邻的,这个单词学计算机的应该很清楚呀!! 并查集的英文(disjoint set union)) {++chambers++}(n.房间), so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.

### Paragraph4 
In the world of capuchins grapes are {++luxury++}(n.奢侈品,adj.奢侈的) goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). 

So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was {++reluctant++}(adj.不情愿的) to hand hers over for a {++mere++}(adj.仅仅,只是) piece of cucumber. 

And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other ^^either^^ {++tossed++}(v.投掷) her own token at the researcher ^^or^^ out of the chamber, ^^or^^ refused to accept the slice of cucumber. 

Indeed, the mere {++presence++}(n.出席,存在) of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to {++induce++}(v.引诱) {++resentment++}(n.怨恨,不满) in a female capuchin.

### Paragraph5 T24 T25
The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. 

In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. 

Such co-operation is likely to be stable ^^only^^ when each animal feels it is not being cheated. 

Feelings of {++righteous++}(adj.正直的) {++indignation++}(n.愤怒), it seems, are not the {++preserve++}({--v.保护--},n.独有之物,专门活动) of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly(adv.十分地,完全地) clear to other members of the group. 

However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is as yet, {==an unanswered question==}.

回答T24

- prefer grapes to cucumbers
- can be taught to exchange things.
- will not be co-operative if feeling cheated.
- are unhappy when separated from others.

注意题目问的是 "eventually found",即最终结论,而AB都是试验中的现象/结论. D更是无中生有 

C选项来自于In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable {++only++} when each animal feels it is not being cheated. 


回答T25

- Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.
- Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.
- Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.
- Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

这是最后一句话的直接推论,并不需要做过多解释.

{++题干++}

- An argument made by supporters of smoking was that .... 
- According to {++Bruce AIberts++}, science can serve as ....
- What does the author mean by "paralysis by analysis"(Last line, {++Paragraph 4++})? 重点看第四段
- According to the author, what should the Administration do about global warning?
- The author associates the issue of global warning with that of smoking because....?

这篇文章给的定位词就比较少了....
### Paragraph1 
Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the {++doubters++}(n.怀疑论者) insisted that we didn't know for sure? That the evidence was {++inconclusive++}(adj.非决定性的), the science uncertain?That the antismoking lobby(n.大厅;游说团体) was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? 

Lots of Americans bought that {++nonsense++}(n.谬论,胡言乱语), and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early {++graves++}(n. pl坟墓,adj.严肃的).



### Paragraph2
There are {++upsetting++}(adj.令人心烦意乱的) {++parallels++}(adj.平行的 vt.使平行,n.平行线->相似之物) today, ^^as(->because,引导原因状语从句)^^ scientists in {++one wave after another++}(一波又一波) try to awaken us to the growing {++threat++}(n.威胁) of global warming. 

The latest was a {++panel++}(n.专家小组,仪表盘) from the National Academy of Sciences, {++enlisted++}(v.招募,从军,支持) by the White House, to tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. 

The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. 

The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the {++preface++}(n.序言/开端) to the panel's report: "Science never has all the answers. 

But science ^^does^^(强调) provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is {++critical++}(adj.批判的,关键的) that our {++nation++}(n.国家,民族) and the world base important policies on the best {++judgments++}(n.判断(力)) that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions."

这一句比较长,翻译出来时 {++}
### Paragraph3
Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it's OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. 

This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. 

With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.

### Paragraph4
Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. 

But it's obvious that a majority of the president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously. 

Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research – a classic case of "paralysis by analysis".

### Paragraph5
To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. 

But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won't take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. 

A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. 

Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. 

If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.
